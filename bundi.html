                        A prolific and distinct school of painting flourished in Bundi
                        in the seventeenth century, which is remarkable for its
                        unblemished colour sense and excellent formal design.
                        Bundi Ragamala dated 1591, assigned to the earliest
                        and formative phase of Bundi painting, has been painted at
                        Chunar in the reign of Bhoj Singh (1585-1607), the Hada
                        Rajput ruler.
                    </p>




                    <p>
                        The Bundi school blossomed under the patronage of two
                        rulers - Rao Chattar Sal (1631-1659), who was made the
                        governor of Delhi by Shahjahan and played a conspicuous
                        role in the subjugation of the Deccan; and his son Rao Bhao
                        Singh (1659-1682), who was an enthusiastic, self-indulging
                        patron as revealed from numerous portraits that he
                        commissioned of himself and other dated works. Innovative
                        developments have been observed under the reigns of his
                        successors Aniruddha Singh (1682-1702) and Budh Singh,
                        whose whiskered face is visible in many portraits. Despite
                        numerous political disputes and having lost his kingdom four
                        times, he is known to have encouraged the art of painting.

                        Painting activity entered its most accomplished phase
                        albeit for a short time during the long reign of Budh
                        Singh's son, Umed Singh (1749-1771), where it acquired
                        refinement in minuteness of details. Bundi paintings during
                        the eighteenth century appear to have imbibed Deccani
                        aesthetics, such as love for bright and vivid colours. Umed Singh's successor Bishen Singh
                        (1771-1821) ruled
                        Bundi for 48 years and was a connoisseur of art. He had
                        a keen interest in hunting, and him hunting wild animals
                        frequently figures in the paintings of his period. Under his
                        successor Ram Singh (1821-1889), the chitrashalain of the
                        Bundi palace was decorated with mural paintings of royal
                        processions, hunting scenes and episodes of Krishna's story.
                        Last stages of painting at Bundi are best exemplified by
                        several wall paintings in the palace.

                        A distinct feature of Bundi and
                        Kota School is a keen interest in the
                        depiction of lush vegetation; picturesque
                        landscape with varied flora, wildlife
                        and birds; hills and thick jungles; and
                        water bodies. It also has a series of fine
                        equestrian portraits. The drawing of
                        elephants is, particularly, unsurpassed
                        in both Bundi and Kota. Bundi artists
                        had their own standards of feminine
                        beauty - women are petite with round
                        faces, receding foreheads, sharp noses,
                        full cheeks, sharply penciled eyebrows
                        and a 'pinched' waist.
                        Bundi's earliest phase of painting,
                        Bundi Ragamala bears an inscription
                        in Persian that dates back to 1591,
                        mentions names of its artists - Shaykh
                        Hasan, Shaykh Ali and Shaykh Hatim,
                        who introduce themselves as pupils of
                        master artists, Mir Sayyid Ali and Khwaja
                        Abddus Samad of the Mughal court.
                        They mention Chunar (near Benaras)
                        as the place of origin of the painting,
                        where Rao Bhoj Singh and his father
                        Rao Surjan Singh maintained a palace.
