            The architecture of Rajasthan has usually been a regional variant of the style of Indian architecture
            prevailing in north India at the time. Rajasthan is especially notable for the forts and palaces of the
            many Rajput rulers, which are popular tourist attractions.

            The term 'Rajasthani Schools of Painting' pertains to
            the schools of painting that prevailed in the princely
            kingdoms and thikanas of what roughly constitutes Rajasthan
            and parts of Madhya Pradesh in the present time, such as
            Mewar, Bundi, Kota, Jaipur, Bikaner, Kishangarh, Jodhpur
            (Marwar), Malwa, Sirohi and other such principalities largely
            between the sixteenth and early nineteenth centuries.

            Though separated by short distances, the pictorial
            styles that emerged and evolved in these kingdoms were
            significantly diverse in terms of either execution - fine or
            bold; preference of colours (brilliant or gentle); compositional
            elements (depiction of architecture, figures and nature);
            modes of narration; affinity for naturalism - or had emphasis
            on extreme mannerism.

            Paintings were painted on waslis - layered, thin sheets of
            handmade papers glued together to get the desired thickness.
            The outline was sketched on waslis in black or brown
            followed by colours fixed therein by brief notations or sample
            patches. Colour pigments were predominantly obtained from
            minerals and precious metals like gold and silver that were
            mixed with glue as the binding medium. Camel and squirrel
            hair were used in brushes. On completion, the painting was
            burnished with an agate to lend it a uniform sheen and an
            appealing resplendence.
            The painting activity was a kind of teamwork, with the
            master artist composing and doing preliminary drawings,
            followed by pupils or experts of colouring, portraiture,
            architecture, landscape, animals, etc., taking over and doing
            their bit, and finally, the master artist putting the finishing
            touches. The scribe would write the verse in the space left
            for the one.

            Jain temples and monasteries had mural paintings from at least 2,000 years ago, though pre-medieval
            survivals are rare. In addition, many Jain manuscripts were illustrated with paintings, sometimes
            lavishly so. In both these cases, Jain art parallels Hindu art, but the Jain examples are more numerous
            among the earliest survivals. The manuscripts begin around the 11th century, but are mostly from the
            13th onwards, and were made mainly in Gujarat, with some in Rajasthan. By the 15th-century they were
            becoming increasingly lavish, with much use of gold.

            Like Mughal art, Rajasthani paintings were meant to be kept in boxes or albums and to be viewed by
            passing
            from hand to hand. The technique is similar to that of Mughal painting, though the materials are not as
            refined and sumptuous.
            The study of Rajasthani painting is comparatively young, and new material is continually being
            uncovered. Distinct schools
            have been separated out on the basis of style, such as Mewar painting, Bundi painting and that of its
            neighbouring
            sister state of Kotah, Kishangarh painting, Bikaner, Jaipur, Marwar, and, outside Rajasthan proper,
            Malwa painting,
            also referred to as Central Indian painting.
